<!-- Plugin Credit and Acknowledgement:
  This alert is an update of Eric Krebill's SPED Accommodations for MI Schools V3.3
  https://support.powerschool.com/exchange/view.action?download.id=705
  It has been updated to reference the MI State Reporting Extension field instead of the legacy custom field.
  It also adds an image selector allowing districts to choose from 1 of 12 images for their Special Education alert.
